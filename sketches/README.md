# 📂 Sketches

This directory contains all firmware sketches for the **GadgetGizmo** project.  
Each sketch is stored in its own folder, named after the `.ino` file inside.  
Use these as starting points or reference implementations when developing new firmware.

## 📝 Contribution & Guidelines

To keep this folder organized:  

1. 📁 **One sketch per folder**  
   - The folder name should match the main `.ino` file inside.  

2. 🏷 **Naming convention**  
   - Use lowercase, descriptive names (`example`, `fidget`, `sensor_test`).  
   - Avoid spaces, use underscores if needed.  

3. 📑 **Per-sketch README**  
   - Each sketch folder should include a short `README.md` explaining:  
     - Purpose of the sketch  
     - Features  
     - Any special hardware setup  

4. 🛠 **Arduino IDE ready**  
   - Each folder should be self-contained and openable directly in the Arduino IDE.
